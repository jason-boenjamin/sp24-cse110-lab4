## Let Declaration

3. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. ^^^^^
    1. "values add: 20". No errors
4. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.

5. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. ^^^^^
    1. Nothing is printed by line 9 since result is a const variable that tried to be reassigned, throwing an error.
6. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.
   1. Similar to my answer in question 5, an error was thrown since the 'const' variable tried to be reassigned.
